todo list that wipes itself clean every day

i've tried so many different todo systems, and most of them didn't work for me. until one day, i built myself pretty much the perfect one in Notion: a todo list that starts out blank every day! for me, todo lists become unusable once they start becoming too overwhelming, and a todo list that just keeps growing every day has that problem. i could let the undone tasks sit in a backlog, nagging me every day that they weren't done yet (which is what most popular todo apps do), but this just leads to me not using them. if instead a task that wasn't done for the day just... disappears forever, then the list can never get too big! but of course, that can be a bit problematic if there's a task i didn't get to but that's still important. so i built in a buffer: i can still see tasks from yesterday. but if even by *then* i haven't done the task, then it's probably not important, and should be deleted. 

this works for simple everyday tasks. works very well actually! but for any tasks that need doing in the near or far future, what do i do with those? well, within notion, i made another system that organises those tasks into different categories. for example a list of tasks for health, another one for beauty, and so on. the key with that system is that it didn't have any due date reminders attached - no nagging. all the tasks were sitting quietly within the different categories (which i called "projects"), ready to be dragged into my self-cleaning daily todo list whenever i was ready to work on them.

but Notion is cumbersome. the website is slow, the desktop app is basically just the website, the data is in the hands of a corporation, the phone app is horrible to use. 

so here's my attempt to recreate this system, but as an actual application!
